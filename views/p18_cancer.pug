  p Cancer and cancer treatments are often associated with nutritional problems. Your body must get the calories and nutrients it needs to maintain a healthy weight.
  p Cancer treatment places a high demand on the body. Nutrition support may help you maintain your body weight and meet your body's energy and nutrient requirements at this vital time.
  p A consultation with a dietitian will help you to prepare for the effects of the treatments for cancer, and can help to ensure that your particular nutritional needs are met at this time.
